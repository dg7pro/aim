    <p class="head">Overview</p>
    
    <p class="info">Here you can view a dispute ticket and manage the dispute. Dispute tickets are the same as standard tickets, with the exception being
    multiple people can reply to the same ticket. Useful if you have a gaming site and have disputes between users etc</p>
    
    <p class="head">Create Dispute</p>
    
    <p class="info">To convert a ticket into a dispute, view the standard ticket and click 'Create Dispute' from the top menu (as shown <a href="tickets_7.html">here</a>). Then refer to the 'Other Dispute Users' section below.</p>
    
    <p class="head">Quick Link Bar</p>
    
    <p class="info"><img src="images/helpdesk/18.jpg" class="sysimg" alt="" title="" /><br /><br />
    This contains the dispute ID and its status, along with the following:<br /><br />
    <b>Add Reply</b> - Slow scrolls to reply box<br />
    <b>Close</b> - Closes dispute. No emails are sent.<br />
    <b>Lock</b> - Locks dispute. If locked, visitor cannot re-open dispute. No emails are sent.<br />
    <b>Create Ticket</b> - Reverts dispute back to standard ticket. No emails are sent. If this is used, all dispute users and their replies are deleted from the system.
    </p>
    
    <p class="head">Other Dispute Users</p>
    
    <p class="info">When you have converted a ticket to a dispute, you need to add other users to the dispute. To do this, firstly, click the icon on the 'Other Dispute Users'
    bar to launch the dispute users window:<br /><br />
    <img src="images/helpdesk/19.jpg" class="sysimg" alt="" title="" /><br /><br />
    You can add as many users as you need and you can batch add them. Note that the free version may have restrictions. Use the +/ symbols to add/remove boxes. Once you have 
    entered the names/email addresses click the button to add the users. <b style="color:red">You do NOT have to enter the original users email address, this person is already
    in the dispute. If you do enter it, it will be ignored</b>:<br /><br />
    <img src="images/helpdesk/20.jpg" class="sysimg" alt="" title="" /><br /><br />
    Once you have added the users, emails get sent:<br /><br />
    - The original user is notified that their ticket has now been converted to a dispute and it details the other users in the dispute. This is <b>ONLY</b> sent if
    the '<b>Open Dispute Notification</b>' box is checked (see above).<br /><br />
    - Other users get notification to let them know a dispute has been opened against them. Note that if a users email doesn`t exist in the system, an account
    is auto created for them.
    </p>
    
    <p class="head">Edit/Delete Other Users from Dispute</p>
    
    <p class="info">In the dispute window, use the edit icons or checkboxes to edit or delete other dispute users. When deleting, select the delete option from the drop down:<br /><br />
    <img src="images/helpdesk/21.jpg" class="sysimg" alt="" title="" /><br /><br />
    Deleting a user will also delete all replies by that user, but it won`t remove their account.
    </p>
    
    <p class="head">Dispute Users Post Privileges</p>
    
    <p class="info">You can enable/disable post prvileges if you want to for other dispute users as well as the original dispute ticket user. This is useful if you have a lot of people in a dispute and people keep posting too much or out of turn. To batch change post permissions for other users view the dispute window:<br /><br />
    <img src="images/helpdesk/22.jpg" class="sysimg" alt="" title="" /><br /><br />
    Coloured markers denote current status. You can also click the name on the main screen to enable/disable privileges. This is required for the main user:<br /><br />
    <img src="images/helpdesk/23.jpg" class="sysimg" alt="" title="" />
    </p>
    
    <p class="head">User Details</p>
    
    <p class="info">Details of the original dispute ticket, including the department, user and email are shown in the right hand menu.</p>
    
    <p class="head">Edit Ticket</p>
    
    <p class="info">Clicking the icon on the dispute subject bar launches the dispute ticket edit window.<br /><br />
    <img src="images/helpdesk/24.jpg" class="sysimg" alt="" title="" /><br /><br />

    <b>Template Language</b> - This is only relevant if you are using the multi language option.<br /><br />
    <img src="images/helpdesk/10.jpg" class="sysimg" alt="" title="" />
    </p>
    
    <p class="head">Edit Notification</p>
    
    <p class="info">If there is more than 1 support team user in the system, an optional box is shown in the dispute edit window called 'Describe this Change for Other Users'. Text
    entered here is sent in an email to other users. Useful if you make major edits and want to inform other users. If the box is left blank, no email is sent.<br /><br />
    Silent mode is also available to the administrative user. If this is enabled, dispute edit notification is always sent, but only to the administrative user (unless email overrides are
    in place).<br /><br />
    To enable this, open the 'admin/control/user-defined/defined2.inc.php' file and set the 'ENABLE_SILENT_EDIT_NOTIFICATION', to 1.<br /><br />
    You can also send this to alternative email addresses via the 'ENABLE_SILENT_EDIT_NOTIFICATION_EMAIL' override option, which is useful if other users need to be informed. Enter
    addresses, separated with a comma. Example:<br /><br />
    <b>define('ENABLE_SILENT_EDIT_NOTIFICATION', 1);<br />
    define('ENABLE_SILENT_EDIT_NOTIFICATION_EMAIL', 'joe@gmail.com,fred@gmail.com,sarah@yahoo.co.uk');  </b>

    </p>
    
    <p class="head">Assign To</p>
    
    <p class="info">This enables you to assign the dispute to specific users ONLY, but ONLY if the dispute department is set to have tickets manually assigned to users.<br /><br />
    This is ONLY seen by the administrator OR if a user has access to the ticket assign page. Only users assigned to specific disputes can see them, along with the administrator who by default, can
    always see all disputes. Use the checkboxes provided to assign disputes. Disputes can be assigned to a single user or multiple users.<br /><br />
    Note that further notifications are only sent to assigned users, so if you are the administrator and want to receive dispute reply notifications, you should always add yourself to the assigned list.<br /><br />
    <img src="images/helpdesk/59.jpg" class="sysimg" alt="" title="" /><br /><br />
    If a dispute is not assigned, it defaults to being viewable by all users who have access to its department.
    </p>
    
    <p class="head">Notepad</p>
    
    <p class="info">The notepad is a useful feature that lets you make notes about a dispute ticket. This is not seen by visitors, but can be viewed and edited by users
