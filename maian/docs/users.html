    <p class="head">Administrator</p>
    
    <p class="info">
    When the system is setup you choose a username/password for the main administrative user during the installation procedure. If you ran the manual install option, an administrator is created with the following details:<br /><br />
    <b>E-Mail</b>: admin@email.com<br />
    <b>Password</b>: admin<br /><br />
    You should log in and update these details as soon as possible. Change the e-mail, password &amp; username/alias.<br /><br />The administrator cannot be deleted from the system and by default has access to ALL areas at ALL times. This is to prevent you from locking
    yourself out of the system accidentally.
    </p>
    
    <p class="head">Name/Alias</p>
    
    <p class="info">This is the users username or full name.
    </p>
    
    <p class="head">Login E-Mail</p>
    
    <p class="info">Login email address and address ticket notifications are sent to.
    </p>
    
    <p class="head">Enter New Password</p>
    
    <p class="info">Enter login password. The use of special characters is recommended for more difficult passwords. ie: []()*/<br /><br />Use the 'Generate' option to help generate a more secure password. When editing, leave blank to keep same password.<br /><br />
    For the generate option, click 'Generate'. Select which type of characters you want in the password and click the 'Create' button. This will give you a preview of the password before it
    is added to the box. If you don`t like that password, click 'Cancel' to generate another.<br /><br />
    <img src="images/helpdesk/1.jpg" class="sysimg" alt="" title="" /><br /><br />
    Using combinations of all ensures better security.
    </p>
    
    <p class="head">Department Access</p>
    
    <p class="info">If a user has access to department tickets, they can view all tickets in that department and will be notified when tickets are opened in that department for departments where user assign is not enabled. For departments where manual assign is enabled, the ticket will become visible under the department once assigned. 
    If a ticket is assigned to a user in a department they don`t have access to, they will still be able to view the ticket as it is assigned to them.<br /><br />
    If a user has access to assigned tickets only, they can ONLY view ticket(s) assigned to them, regardless of ticket department. But, when updating a ticket, only departments set to manual assign are shown.<br /><br />The administrator can always view all tickets regardless of this setting.
    </p>
    
    <p class="head">Admin Page Access</p>
    
    <p class="info">Specify which admin pages this user has access to. This can restrict user from accessing certain administration content.<br /><br /><b>WARNING</b>!

    <p class="head">Ticket 'From' E-Mail Address</p>
    
    <p class="info">From email address visitor sees in their email program when this user replies to a ticket and notification is sent. Can be the same as login email or different.<br /><br />If left blank, defaults to login email.

    <p class="info">If a user responds to a ticket, do you want their signature (if applicable) to be included in e-mail notifications?<br /><br />Note that if HTML is included in e-mail signatures you MUST enable the html e-mail option in the following file:<br /><br />
    <b>control/user-defined/defined.inc.php</b>
    </p>
    
    <p class="head">E-Mail Notification</p>
